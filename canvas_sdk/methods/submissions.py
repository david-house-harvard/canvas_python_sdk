Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding extra credit. percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as "40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100% are allowed, for awarding extra credit. letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in points or percentage rather than the letter grade. "pass/complete/fail/incomplete":: A string value of "pass" or "complete" will give a score of 100%. "fail" or "incomplete" will give a score of 0. Note that assignments with grading_type of "pass_fail" can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween.

The general format is, for each row in the rubric: rubric_assessment[criterion_id][points]:: The points awarded for this row. rubric_assessment[criterion_id][comments]:: Comments to add for this row. For example, if the assignment rubric is (in JSON format): !!!javascript [ { 'id': 'crit1', 'points': 10, 'description': 'Criterion 1', 'ratings': [ { 'description': 'Good', 'points': 10 }, { 'description': 'Poor', 'points': 3 } ] }, { 'id': 'crit2', 'points': 5, 'description': 'Criterion 2', 'ratings': [ { 'description': 'Complete', 'points': 5 }, { 'description': 'Incomplete', 'points': 0 } ] } ] Then a possible set of values for rubric_assessment would be: rubric_assessment[crit1][points]=3&rubric_assessment[crit2][points]=5&rubric_assessment[crit2][comments]=Well%20Done.

    Comment on and/or update the grading for a student's assignment submission.
    If any submission or rubric_assessment arguments are provided, the user
    must have permission to manage grades in the appropriate context (course or
    section).

        :param request_ctx: The request context
        :type request_ctx: :class:RequestContext
        :param section_id: (required) ID
        :type section_id: string
        :param assignment_id: (required) ID
        :type assignment_id: string
        :param user_id: (required) ID
        :type user_id: string
        :param comment_text_comment: (optional) Add a textual comment to the submission.
        :type comment_text_comment: string or None
        :param comment_group_comment: (optional) Whether or not this comment should be sent to the entire group (defaults to false). Ignored if this is not a group assignment or if no text_comment is provided.
        :type comment_group_comment: boolean or None
        :param comment_media_comment_id: (optional) Add an audio/video comment to the submission. Media comments can be added via this API, however, note that there is not yet an API to generate or list existing media comments, so this functionality is currently of limited use.
        :type comment_media_comment_id: string or None
        :param comment_media_comment_type: (optional) The type of media comment being added.
        :type comment_media_comment_type: string or None
        :param comment_file_ids: (optional) Attach files to this comment that were previously uploaded using the Submission Comment API's files action
        :type comment_file_ids: integer or None
        :param submission_posted_grade: (optional) Assign a score to the submission, updating both the "score" and "grade" fields on the submission record. This parameter can be passed in a few different formats: points:: A floating point or integral value, such as "13.5". The grade will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment. Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding extra credit. percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as "40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100% are allowed, for awarding extra credit. letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in points or percentage rather than the letter grade. "pass/complete/fail/incomplete":: A string value of "pass" or "complete" will give a score of 100%. "fail" or "incomplete" will give a score of 0. Note that assignments with grading_type of "pass_fail" can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween. If a posted_grade in the "points" or "percentage" format is sent, the grade will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.
        :type submission_posted_grade: string or None
        :param rubric_assessment: (optional) Assign a rubric assessment to this assignment submission. The sub-parameters here depend on the rubric for the assignment. The general format is, for each row in the rubric: rubric_assessment[criterion_id][points]:: The points awarded for this row. rubric_assessment[criterion_id][comments]:: Comments to add for this row. For example, if the assignment rubric is (in JSON format): !!!javascript [ { 'id': 'crit1', 'points': 10, 'description': 'Criterion 1', 'ratings': [ { 'description': 'Good', 'points': 10 }, { 'description': 'Poor', 'points': 3 } ] }, { 'id': 'crit2', 'points': 5, 'description': 'Criterion 2', 'ratings': [ { 'description': 'Complete', 'points': 5 }, { 'description': 'Incomplete', 'points': 0 } ] } ] Then a possible set of values for rubric_assessment would be: rubric_assessment[crit1][points]=3&rubric_assessment[crit2][points]=5&rubric_assessment[crit2][comments]=Well%20Done.
